# Utilities

This repository contains a set of small, reusable scripts and tools designed to make development tasks faster and easier.  

Current utilities include:

- **fconv** â€“ Dockerized image converter that converts JPG/PNG files to WebP.

Each utility lives in its own subfolder with instructions for usage and setup.  

Feel free to clone the entire repo or use individual utilities as needed.
